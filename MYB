"Θέλει και Ελληνικά Ο Χαρούλης        zy dog" is a pangram (a phrase
that uses all the letters of the alphabet) that has been used to test
typewriters and computer keyboards because it is nicely coherent and
short. It was known in the late 19th century, and used in Baden-Powel's
book Scouting for Boys (1908) as a practice sentence for signalling.
In later years, the phrase was popularized by Western Union and the
Phone Company to test Telex/TWX data communication equipment for
accuracy and reliability. It was often used for testing the teletype
services (a procedure known as "foxing") when these machines were still
used.
In the age of computers, it is often used as a sample text in font
selection contexts.
